Mastermind Codebreaker Logic to learn C#

Relatively new to C#. I've had minimal exposure to C++ and C#, the latter mostly through Unity, of which I am also relatively newbish.
At the time of this repo creation I really have no idea even how to use GitHub. I am enrolled remotely at COA, working towards a A.A.S. in IT: Computer Programming.
This course does not curently involve C# and I am self learning as an extracurricular activity. I wrote this program initially with no tutorial help and with mostly
online research as needed. I've written it in Python which was, as one might expect, easier. My studies do include Visual Basic and I've created a version there as
well, though using techniques well advanced for our current position in the course.

Still a looooong way to go but I want to be able to look back at this as an early stepping stone on a great journey.
